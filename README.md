Data results 
In Mexico, the impact estimate is 0.10 standard deviations with a standard error of 0.12. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -0.14 to 0.34. In Brazil, the impact estimate is 0.07 standard deviations with a standard error of 0.03. The 95% confidence interval ranges from 0.01 to 0.13. Based on the statistical significance, the confidence interval for Mexico includes zero, which implies that the impact estimate is not statistically significant. In contrast, the confidence interval for Brazil does not include zero, implying a statistically significant positive impact on short-term cognitive development. Based on the magnitude of Impact, while the point estimate for Mexico is slightly higher (0.10) than for Brazil (0.07), the lack of statistical significance for Mexico implies that we cannot confidently state there was an improvement due to the CCT program. Brazil’s result is both statistically significant and positive.
To policy makers/legislator
Upon reviewing the impact estimates for the CCT programs on short-term cognitive development, the data shows that while the effect size is slightly larger for Mexico, this difference is not statistically significant, as the confidence interval includes zero. This means we cannot be confident that the CCT program had an impact on short-term cognitive development in Mexico. Conversely, the results for Brazil show a smaller effect size but with statistical significance, since the confidence interval does not include zero. This indicates that we can be confident about the positive impact of the CCT on short-term cognitive development in Brazil. Therefore, while the CCT's effect in Mexico may seem larger at first glance, the results are statistically significant only for Brazil. Therefore, the legislator's position aligns more closely with what the data indicates about the program's effectiveness in the short term for cognitive development. 
To conclude, while Mexico's program might have aimed for a higher impact, the data supports that Brazil's program had a more reliable positive effect on children's short-term cognitive development than Mexico. Therefore, I would conclude that the CCT program in Brazil has had a clear positive impact on short-term cognitive development, while the evidence for Mexico is inconclusive due to the lack of statistical significance. While Mexico's estimate suggests a potential for a higher impact, only Brazil's results are statistically reliable. Consequently, the legislator's position is more consistent with the statistical evidence presented in the table.
Compressed
Short-term cognitive development-The impact estimate for Brazil is 0.07 standard deviations, with a confidence interval of between 0.01 and 0.13 hence statistically significant with positive impact of CCTs on short-term cognitive development in Brazil.
There is a real and positive effect of CCTs on short-term cognitive development in children. 
Long-term Cognitive Development-The impact on long-term cognitive development is also positive at 0.11 standard deviations, with a statistically significant confidence interval (0.07 to 0.15). 
Household income-The impact estimate for Brazil is a 10% increase in household income, with a confidence interval ranging from 5% to 15%. Therefore, statistically significant positive impact of CCTs on household income in Brazil. The results for the poorest quartile indicates a positive increase (0.69 standard deviations). 
Recommendation-Based on the statistically significant positive impacts of Conditional cash transfers observed in both short-term and long term cognitive development and household income  for families in the poorest quartile, it is recommended that conditional cash transfers are beneficial to Brazilian citizens. These results indicate that CCT programs is beneficial for Brazilian citizens, in enhancing child development outcomes and providing financial support to low-income households. Therefore, based on the evidence presented in this chart, I would recommend CCTs as a beneficial policy intervention for Brazilian citizens.
Question 2
Analysis of the Data
Short-term cognitive development-The impact estimate for Brazil is 0.07 standard deviations, with a confidence interval of between 0.01 and 0.13. This shows it is statistically significant with positive impact of CCTs on short-term cognitive development in Brazil.
Short-term Cognitive Development-The impact estimate for short-term cognitive development due to CCTs is positive at 0.07 standard deviations. The confidence interval (0.01 to 0.13) does not include zero and is therefore statistically significant. This supports the program. It shows a real and positive effect of CCTs on short-term cognitive development in children. This is an indicator of future academic success and have long-term positive outcomes on human capital development.
Long-term Cognitive Development-The impact on long-term cognitive development is also positive at 0.11 standard deviations, with a statistically significant confidence interval (0.07 to 0.15). The consistency of positive results in both short-term and long-term assessments further supports the effectiveness of the program.
Household income-The impact estimate for Brazil is a 10% increase in household income, with a confidence interval ranging from 5% to 15%. This indicates a statistically significant positive impact of CCTs on household income in Brazil. When looking at family income impacts, the results for the poorest quartile indicates a positive increase (0.69 standard deviations). This implies that CCTs contribute to income improvements for the most disadvantaged. This is vital for poverty reduction and improving overall welfare.
Recommendation-Based on the statistically significant positive impacts observed in both short-term cognitive development and household income, it can be recommended that conditional cash transfers are beneficial to Brazilian citizens.
Reasons for Recommendation
Positive Impact on Cognitive Development-The statistically significant positive impact on short-term cognitive development shows that CCTs are effective in promoting educational outcomes among beneficiaries. This can lead to long-term benefits such as improved academic performance, higher earnings potential, and better socio-economic outcomes.
Increase in Household Income-The statistically significant increase in household income indicates that CCTs contribute to poverty alleviation and economic empowerment among Brazilian citizens. This additional income can help families meet their basic needs, invest in education and healthcare, and improve their overall quality of life.
Considering the positive impacts observed in both cognitive development and household income, it is recommended to continue and potentially expand the implementation of conditional cash transfer programs in Brazil. However, it is important to complement this analysis with a comprehensive evaluation of the program's long-term effects, cost-effectiveness, and potential trade-offs to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes for Brazilian citizens.
Conclusion my point of view
Conditional cash transfers have a positive impact on both cognitive development in the short and long term and on household income, particularly for families in the poorest quartile. These results indicate that CCT programs is beneficial for Brazilian citizens, in enhancing child development outcomes and providing financial support to low-income households, which are key objectives in social policy. Therefore, based on the evidence presented in this chart, I would recommend CCTs as a beneficial policy intervention for Brazilian citizens. However, policy decision should also consider other factors beyond this chart, including program costs, administrative feasibility, and potential long-term economic and social benefits.

Based on this evaluation method and the data provided, we cannot definitively conclude causality. This is due to the following reasons. There is no control group or baseline trend data presented, which means we cannot compare the observed changes against what might have happened without the program. Other factors independent of the Millennium Villages project could have contributed to the observed reduction in child mortality, such as improvements in national healthcare policies, economic growth, or other NGO activities. Mortality rates can fluctuate due to reasons not connected to specific interventions, such as epidemic outbreaks or improvements in overall living conditions.


4 trends 
The national trend from 2001-2010 does not represent an ideal counterfactual for the rate of decline in child mortality in Millennium Villages from 2006 to 2009 for reasons listed below:
Different Time Frames-The national trend covers a different and longer period (2001-2010) compared to the Millennium Villages trend (2006-2009), which may be depicting a different underlying conditions, policies, or health interventions that are not comparable.
The National trends may be influenced by factors such as broad policy changes, international aid, economic development, or nationwide health programs that may not be present or implemented in the same way in the Millennium Villages.
There is a National data aggregates information from diverse rural areas, possibly diluting specific local factors that could impact mortality rates differently in the Millennium Villages.
The Rural areas within a country can be highly heterogeneous. The Millennium Villages were selected specifically for the project, and their characteristics might not reflect the average rural area within the country.
The period between 2001-2010 could have seen other external influences (such as epidemics, natural disasters, or economic crises) that greatly affected child mortality rates. This might not have been equally distributed across all rural areas.
5 better comparison 
A better comparison consist of the following 
Control Villages with Pre-intervention Data- The control villages that were similar to the Millennium Villages in all respects except for the intervention, with data collected both before and after the intervention period for both groups.
Matched Comparison Group- Employing statistical techniques to match Millennium Villages with similar villages that did not receive the intervention
Geographically and Temporally Close Counterfactuals- The villages within the same region and affected by similar external conditions during the same timeframe serve as a more appropriate counterfactual.
Adjustments for Other Interventions- The accounting for other health interventions or programs that influence child mortality rates during the same period to isolate the impact of the Millennium Villages project.

Yes, there are several issues with this data collection method. Firstly, recall bias can affect the accuracy of the data, as people's memories of events three years prior may not be reliable. Secondly, since the intervention had already been implemented for three years, people's perceptions and recollections of the baseline period could have been influenced by the changes they had experienced since then. This influence can distort the baseline measurement, making it seem better or worse than it was, depending on the individuals' current situations.
